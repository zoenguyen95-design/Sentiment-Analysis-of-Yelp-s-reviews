# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Yelp-s-reviews
This dataset is from the yelp. Yelp is a crowd-sourced local business review and social networking site.  Yelp users can submit a review of their products or services using a one to five star rating scale. We would like to predict consumer experience by their comments and star-rating.  
We used sentiment analysis to process of determining whether a text is positive or negative. “A sentiment analysis system for text analysis combines natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to assign weighted sentiment scores to the entities, topics, themes and categories within a sentence or phrase”[1]
In the dataset, we assume that the star-rating greater than 3 menas that a positive experience and vice versa.
